class Microphone(ThreadedSubscriptionProducer):

    Reads microphone data, and writes audio output. This class allows you to
    output sound while reading it.

    Args:
        samplerate (int,optional):
            The sampling rate in Hz. Default is 48000.
        channels (int,list(int),optional):
            The index of channel to record.
            Allows a list of indices. Records on all available channels by default.
        blocksize (int,optional):
            Records this many samples at a time. A lower block size will give lower latency,
            but higher CPU usage.
        device (:class:`soundcard._Microphone`):
            The :mod:`soundcard` device to record from. Uses default if not specified.
